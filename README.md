This code outlines the key steps in the process of aggregating 1 km gridded population counts to the administrative units in the net migration dataset.
"To accurately assess the impact of emigration on mean years of schooling, it was necessary to harmonize data from the two different sources: the net migration dataset (Niva et al., 2023) and the SHDD (Permanyer and Smits, 2020). While the migration dataset carries 2,067 administrative units, the SHDD uses only 1,600 administrative units. Therefore, many units in the migration dataset had to be aggregated into larger units that fit the SHDD administrative units.
To harmonize the datasets, the first step involved using the same population data as Niva et al. (2023) to obtain population counts for each 1km grid cell within the administrative units defined in the migration dataset. This population data is sourced from the WorldPop Hub, which provides high-resolution (1km gridded) population counts. Then, for each administrative unit in the migration dataset, which only reports net migration rates, the total net migration was calculated by multiplying the net migration rate by the respective population count. This step converted the rate-based data into absolute values. The migration data as well as the population count grids are published in geographical file format, which were combined in R Studio. The full code of the process is available in the appendix."
